These files provide generic utilities to execute computations
in parallel using the pthread library.
test_main.cpp provides a usage example

Why did I use .hpp instead of hiding the implementation - 
I started off trying to use boost libraries and ended up with too
many compilation issues, so I stuck to pthreads. The design remained
the same as the original which attempted to mimic the boost way of
things.

How not to use this code?
Don't use this in any non-trivial situation. No sharing of 
file handles, db handles. This is the first time I've ever
used pthreads (or written any other multi-threaded code for
that matter), so I expect there to be several situations
in which this doesn't work.
