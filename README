It's highly unlikely that any of this will be of any use to anyone, 
but I had to lay down the rules just in case.
I don't know much about licenses, but this code is available for reuse
as is and or refactored reuse, or algorithmic/methodological inspiration
by anyone as long as
1) you give me credit and do not profit from it
   monetarily
2) you ask me for permission if you intend to profit from it monetarily,
   and I give it to you
